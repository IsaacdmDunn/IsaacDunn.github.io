            <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
            <p>
                Hi I am Isaac Dunn, a software engineer and aspiring game developer. I am interested in AI for games and any various topics that catch my interest.
Born in Gosport, Hampshire, I then moved to Lincolnshire before moving to Staffordshire for university where I studied my BSC and MSC in Games Programming and 
Software Engineering respectively. I originally became interested in programming from the age of 8 from my love of games where I would spend countless hours 
designing a game on paper before trying and failing to make it in Game Maker. Through the years I would eventually make my way to developing games in other engines 
like Unity, Pico-8 and eventually 2D game engine development in Java. I would then go on to start college where I began to hone in my skills professionally learning 
C++, C# as well as some website development skills before starting at Staffordshire University for Games Programming (BSC) where I looked into various disciplines like network, 
low level, graphical and engine development which while I enjoyed, AI was the skill I enjoyed most using skills such as A* pathfinding, Boids, Genetic Algorithms and Neural Networks 
with my dissertation being about the use of behavioural and emotional AI for story driven events as seen in games like Rimworld and Dwarf Fortress.

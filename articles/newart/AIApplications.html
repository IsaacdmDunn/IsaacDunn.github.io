						<h2 class="major">Boids w/ Genetic Algorithm</h2>

						<p>AI applications were 2 AI modules that I studied with a total of 4 projects starting with a boids simulation with biods simulating group flocking behaviours
							 using seperation, alignment and cohesion. This was also given a predator that would chase boids and destroy them on contact with the boids also having a 
							 flee behaviour to avoid predators. This project also has genetic algorithms to allow the boids to adapt to avoid the predator better over time.

						<h2 class="major">Tower Defence AI with Genetic Algorithms</h2>

						<p>This was a Tower Defence AI that would use a genetic algorithm to encode where to place a tower on the game map as well as which one 
							to place giving the AI a strategy plan for how to place the towers. While the strategy was successful at completing many waves the lack of 
							threading made testing slow often taking hours per generation of AI<a href="https://github.com/IsaacdmDunn/ProjectTactics"><span class="label"> (Github)</span><!--</a> and <a href="https://isaac-dunn.itch.io/pacman"> <span class="label">(Itch.io)</span></a>--></p>
						
						<h2 class="major">Chess MinMax</h2>
						<iframe style = "width:100%" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kw6gfcVt2Tg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
						<p>A chess oppenent AI was developed using a MinMax stragy to predict the best possible move to make over many turns using a 
							heuristic algorithm that gave points to the AI to encourage them to take pieces and advantagous positions. To optimize the AI 
							alpha-beta pruning was used to remove poor performing branches of possible moves.<a href="https://github.com/IsaacdmDunn/ProjectTactics"><span class="label"> (Github)</span><!--</a> and <a href="https://isaac-dunn.itch.io/pacman"> <span class="label">(Itch.io)</span></a>--></p>
						
						<h2 class="major">Neural Network Flappy Bird AI</h2>
						<iframe style = "width:100%" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kw6gfcVt2Tg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
						<p>A neural network has been developed to play flappy with an improvement on the other training examples of multiple instances being played concurrently. There were issues during the development of this system with the back propergation required to allow the AI to train correctly.<a href="https://github.com/IsaacdmDunn/ProjectTactics"><span class="label"> (Github)</span><!--</a> and <a href="https://isaac-dunn.itch.io/pacman"> <span class="label">(Itch.io)</span></a>--></p>
